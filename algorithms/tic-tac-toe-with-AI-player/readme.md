# Tic-tac-toe with AI Player

## Final Project for Standford Code in Place 2023

## I built a graphical tic-tac-toe game with AI functionality. 

### Project Details
This project involves the implementation of a Tic-tac-toe game with an AI player utilizing the minimax algorithm. 
The AI player's decision-making process is limited to a `single depth`, *specifically the final move*, to provide users with an opportunity to win some games. 
The initial moves of the AI player are determined by heuristics, including a preference for starting in the center square and responding with a corner square when the opponent starts with the center square.
