# Predicting Graduate Admission Prediction

Graduate admissions process is very competitive and depends on various factors publications, GPA etc.  

The goal of project is to build a ML model to predict admission of students using these factors above and comparing with an out of sample dataset to evaluate performance.
Also possibly, checking if there are more important features i.e. less factors are able predict to a great level.
